What is teton-wt?
```
A brief attempt at making a walkie-talkie web application.
```
// ----------------- How to run the project ----------------- //
- download the code
- cd into the project using terminal / or open project in terminal using file explorer
- type 
```
npm install
```
- in the terminal 
- once packages have installed, type 
```
node index.js
```
- and open your preferred browser of choice on 
```
localhost:8080
```

// ----------------- Solution ----------------- //
- Details on the solution can be read in the PDF on the about page
- The PDF is located in the assets folder in the root of the project.


// ----------------- Security ----------------- //
- PLEASE NOTE: Due to security concerns on the solution, use a development environment, a virtual machine and a private developer mode browser which you don't mind toggling security flags when prompted to use "camera" and "microphone". 
- All connections are peer to peer and no remote logging or connections are made to the server instance when running.

// ----------------- Conclusion ----------------- //
- I had fun building the project and will a full version in the near future.
